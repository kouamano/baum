Its first edition was released on April 30, 2011.</p><p>Over the years, APAAACI has made remarkable progress with contributions from past presidents and members. It is now positioning itself as an allergy and clinical immunology organization representing the Asia Pacific region.</p><p>During a discussion at the Executive Board Members's meeting in Singapore on July 19, 2009, it was suggested that the publication of an official journal would allow the APAACI to elevate its professional standing, and plans were immediately put into action. After finalizing details of the publication through monthly teleconferences, the launching of the journal was announced to Board Members and House of Delegate members on August 26, 2010.</p><p>I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Prof. Connie H. Katelaris, President of APAAACI, and Prof. Pakit Vichyanond, former President of APAAACI, who had both stressed the necessity and significance of launching a journal and showed passionate enthusiasm during its initial stages. I also would like to thank the board members of APAAACI and the editorial board members of the <italic>Asia Pacific Allergy</italic> journal for their support and sending their precious manuscripts.</p><p>The primary aim of the journal is to serve members of APAAACI by encouraging communication between allergy specialists, doctors, and allied health professionals in the Asia Pacific region. In the coming years, I believe that the journal will grow in influence and be shared by allergy experts around the world as well. In consideration of the situations of member societies, the first several editions of the journal will carry materials focusing on educational content.</p><p>In the 21st century, the Internet has been used as a means of exchanging information both efficiently and rapidly, allowing allergy specialists and other professionals to easily exchange and obtain information on allergies. However, we must also assume grave responsibility for such information as it spreads to ensure accuracy in content. To take advantage of the wide reach of the Internet, the <italic>Asia Pacific Allergy</italic> Journal is basically available as an e-journal. We will send the table of contents via e-mail (eTOC). You may search and download articles at our website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.apallergy.org">www.apallergy.org</ext-link>) for free. <italic>Asia Pacific Allergy</italic> is an Open Access journal. The <italic>Asia Pacific Allergy</italic> journal will be also available as a paper journal if requested.</p><p>In addition, for improved communication and understanding, the journal includes rational concepts related to diagnosis as well as management and educational materials. I anticipate that the number of original papers included in the journal will also continue to rise. I look forward to the day when <italic>Asia Pacific Allergy</italic> becomes a leading citation journal for allergy and clinical immunology in the Asia Pacific region.</p><p>We are looking forward to meeting you through the issues of <italic>Asia Pacific Allergy</italic> journal to come.</p></body><back><bio><p><graphic xlink:href="apa-1-1-g001.gif" position="float"/></p><p><bold>Sang-Il Lee, M.D.</bold></p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 50 Irwon-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul 135-710, Korea.</p><p>Tel: +82-2-3410-3521, Fax: +82-2-3410-0043</p><p><email>editor.apallergy@gmail.com</email></p></bio></back></article>
